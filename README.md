# K6 Basic Implementation

## Project Repo Introduction
This is a personal project for guiding any future developers on doing basic Grafana K6 implementation for any projects to be capable to execute performance testing and load testing in their applications.

### What is Performance Testing?

- Is a type of software testing that is carried out to determine system performance in terms of sensitivity, reactivity, and stability under a particular workload. 
- Ultimately the purpose is to increase system reliability by immitate conditions to uncover potential system issues.

### What is Load Testing?
- Is a type of software testing that determines the performance of a system, software product, or software application under real life based load conditions. 


>[!NOTE] 
>Wouldn't Dashboard Monitor System does that already?
> - YES! It does! Tools like Grafana, Kibana, OpenLens and other tools would do the job. 
> - However we want to discover potential problems occur before we even deploy software into lower levels enviornment and so that when issues occur they are visible and we have already anticipated when spoted.
